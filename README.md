# RainyDays

![image](images/rainydays.png)

The project was made to be an online shop selling special jackets made for extreme conditions by a small Norwegian company. The design should reflect the message of the online store to tempt the buyers.

## Description

The RainyDays site was created based on one of three given briefs. The code was first made what you could call both simple and/ or complex at the same time, since when we started the project we had not yet looked at Javascript and API calls. Which means that the code was a lot longer due to every jacket card being made manually. Later however the code was updated with verification and API fetch which means that a lot of the HTML was replaced by Javascript. This means the site was originally created using HTML and CSS, while JS was added later.

The products where added through an API that gathered the products from a headless wordpress that we made during a different assignment. The site was made to be a clothening store selling jackets for all kind of extreme weather. I wanted the site to have a outdoor look which would inspire you to go outside - so created it using bright autmn colors and using images that makes the outside look like the most wonderful place on earth.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank everyone who has patiently helped me truly understand what is behind the code, and I would like to thank everyone who has helped by testing my live sites to find the hidden faults.

In this spesific project I would like to send a big thank you to the information gathered that showed me what damage for example an extra 'div' can do to your code, which I have carried with me when checking wierd behaviour in later codes.
